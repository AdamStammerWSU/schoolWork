# schoolWork
Although this repository was originally inteded for programming assignemnts while in school, it quickly became a tool of backup and file transfer for all of my school related data. The vast majority of my assignments, programming and otherwise, are stored here and more than once this backup has saved me from redoing work lost for one reason or another. Organization is meant to be obvious but my familiarity with this repository, and its contents, has undoubtedly clouded my judgement in that. This repo was never inteded for others to view, but I am now making it public in the hopes that it may help and provide others in understanding my personal and educational works in my undergraduate studies.
