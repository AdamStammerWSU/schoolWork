  <li>Course Structure:
	<ul>
	<li>Instructional Methods: This course will be centered on a sequence of topics
	that present a broad introduction to logic, both formal and informal.
	The method utilized for these topics will be to do the following:
	  <ol type="1">
	  <li>introduce some basic concepts and terminology for the topic
	  (these are the white pages of the textbook)
	  <li>work through a set of Classwork Exercises
	  (students will do their best to work through these on their own prior to class,
	  and then we will go over them together in class)
	  (these are the <font color="yellow">yellow</font> pages of the textbook)
	  <li>students will then complete a homework assignment in the textbook,
	  tear out the pages and turn the homework assignment in to be graded
	  (these are the <font color="green">green</font> pages of the textbook)
	  </ol>
	After a set of related topics have been covered, there will be an exam over these topics.
	Regular attendance and full participation in working through the Classwork Exercises
	is an essential component of the learning method of the course,
	so every student is expected to read over the white pages, at least look over and attempt
	to answer the Classwork Exercise problems, and bring any questions they have to share with the
	class.
	Students should expect to be called upon to answer Classwork Exercises in class.
    </ul>

  <p>

  <li><b>Topics Covered:</b>
  		<ol>
  		<li>Basic terms and concepts of logic
  		<li>Material Logic: this includes common mistaken patterns of reasoning (known as "fallacies")
  		and definitions
  		<li>Deductive Logic: symbolizing sentences,
  		logical properties and relations of propositions,
  		and validity
  		<li>Inductive Logic: inductive generalization, inductive analogy, and cause-and-effect reasoning
  		<li>Explanatory Hypotheses and the Scientific Method
		</ol>

<p>

<li><b>Text:</b>
  <ol>
  <li><i>Evaluating Everyday Reasoning</i>
  <li>Author: Stephen Tramel
  <li>Purchase this text from the Department of History, Political Science, Philosophy and Religion
  as soon as possible as we will use it extensively throughout the course.
  </ol>

<p>

<li><b>Course Objectives:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>All of us rely on logical principles in our everyday lives
  as we are constantly using reasoning to arrive at new beliefs, assess our beliefs,
  and evaluate both our own arguments and the arguments of others.
  <li>In this course we will focus on those aspects of reasoning
  and our logical intuitions that are the most useful in the most frequent forms
  that we encounter in both everyday life: everyday conversations with friends and family,
  political discourse, and in assessing the merits of explanatory hypotheses
  <li>We will also learn enough of formal logic to understand its nature and importance,
  and the benefits it provides for gaining a deeper understanding of ordinary language
  and the propositions we express using it, and their relations.
  <li>We will use formal notation to symbolize sentences,
  that is to represent the propositions expressed by sentences
  in a natural language in a formal notation.
  <li>With this notation, we will then be able to discern
  the logical properties and relations of propositions.
  <li>And we will learn how to demonstrate the validity and invalidity of arguments
  represented in this formal notation.
  </ul>

<p>

<li><b>Goals:</b>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>Cognitive:
    <ol>
    <li>To acquaint you with the terminology, concepts, principles, and methods of
    material and formal logic
	<li>To help you to develop your ability to think critically,
	identify fallacies in the reasoning of others, and to avoid them in your own
	<li>To help you to utilize the tools of formal logic in determining
	the relations between propositions and the formal properties of arguments
	<li>To help you to construct and assess explanatory hypotheses
	</ol>

<p>

  <li>Affective:
	<ol>
	<li>To encourage you to critically scrutinize the claims, arguments,
	and efforts at persuasion of others
	<li>To encourage you to also critically scrutinize your own claims, arguments,
	and efforts at persuasion
	<li>To foster a sense of intellectual integrity and a respect for one's intellectual obligations
	<li>To encourage an appropriate humility about
	one's own particular grasp of the truth and a willingness to honestly, openly,
	and transparently engage in a cooperative pursuit of truth with others
	</ol>
  </ul>

<p>

<li><b>Requirements/Grading:</b>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>Work that will receive a grade:
    <ol>
    <li>Exam #1 = 30%
    <li>Exam #2 = 30%
    <li>Quizzes = 20%
    <li>Homework and Class Participation = 20%
    </ol>
  <li>Expectations:
    <ul>
    <li>Students are expected to do all assigned readings
    and submit all homework assignments on time.
   <li>It cannot be stressed enough that you will need to keep up with the material
  and to let me know as soon as you encounter any difficulties with understanding
  or mastering the material.
    <li>The material covered in this class is at least somewhat cumulative,
  as many sections build on material from previous sections,
  so you cannot skip any of the material nor can you expect to successfully proceed
  until you understand the material from the prior sections.
    </ul>
  <li>Grading Scale:
    <ul>
    <li>A = 100% to 90%
    <li>B =  89.99% to 80%
    <li>C =  79.99% to 70%
    <li>D =  69.99% to 60%
    <li>F =  59.99% to  0%
    </ul>
  <li>Feedback:
   <ul>
   <li>Exams: Every effort will be made to provide feedback on exams in a timely fashion -
   hopefully within one week of submitting the exam.
   <li>Quizzes: Every effort will be made to provide feedback on quizzes in a timely fashion -
   hopefully within one or two class periods of submitting the quiz.
   <li>Homework: Every effort will be made to provide feedback on
   homework assignments in a timely fashion -
   hopefully within one or two class periods of submitting the assignment.
   </ul>
  </ul>

</ol>

<p>

<h2><li>Policies:</h2>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Homework Deadline</b>: All homework assignments are due at the beginning of the class session
  on the day they are due.
  <li><b>Late work</b>: Given the schedule for this course,
  there really is no way to accommodate late work.
  The goal is to have homework graded as quickly as possible
  and then have the answers presented to the class so that they can correct
  any misunderstandings and learn from any mistakes.
  And, clearly, once the answers have been presented to the class,
  no homework could possibly be accepted for even partial credit.
  Thus, there is no provision for accepting any late work for credit in this class.
  <li><b>Regular Attendance</b>: Students are expected to attend every class session.
  If a student has a legitimate reason for being unable to attend a class session,
  they must notify the instructor and take personal responsibility for making up any missed material
  and to turn in any homework assignments that are due at that class session.
  Excessive absences may result in a lowered grade.
  <li><b>Academic honesty</b>: All work submitted is expected to be the work of the student submitting it.
  Any violation of this is grounds for a failing grade for the course, but is not limited to this.
  <li><b>Extra Credit</b>: There will be no extra credit given in this course.
  There are very good reasons for concluding that offering extra credit is unfair,
  and there is ample opportunity for students to demonstrate their mastery of the material presented
  in the course.
  So, do not ask for the opportunity to do extra work for extra credit.
  </ul>

<p>

<h2><li>Statement on Student Academic Integrity and Appeals:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>The University has a clear expectation for academic integrity
  and does not tolerate academic dishonesty.

  and other forms of dishonesty relating to academics.
  <li>The policy and its procedures also set forth how charges of academic dishonesty
  are handled at the University.
  <li>Academic Dishonesty is strictly proscribed and if found may result in student discipline
  up to and including dismissal from the University.
  </ul>

<p>

<h2><li>Statement on Accommodations:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Any student who feels s/he may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact
  Nancy Hartenhoff-Crooks (or successor) Coordinator of Disability Services (605-688-4504 or Fax, 605-688-4987)
  to privately discuss your specific needs.
  <li>The Office of Disability Services is located in room 065, the University Student Union.

<p>

<h2><li>Freedom in Learning Statement:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Students are responsible for learning the content of any course of study in which they are enrolled.
  <li>Under Board of Regents and University policy, student academic performance
  shall be evaluated solely on an academic basis
  and students should be free to take reasoned exception to the data or views offered in any courses of study.
  <li>Students who believe that an academic evaluation is unrelated to academic standards
  but is related instead to judgment of their personal opinion or conduct
  should first contact the instructor of the course.
  <li>If the student remains unsatisfied, the student may contact the Department Head, Dean, or both,
  of the college which offers the class to initiate a review of the evaluation.
