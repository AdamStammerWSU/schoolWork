Research Project Idea: Compare the power consumption of various algorithms, languages, operations, and or hardware, as applied to microprocessors. Perhaps the ATTiny family would be good a testing platform. 
Write algorithms in C and Assembly for the microprocessor. Compare timing, energy use, timing, memory use, etc. Compare the assembly code too.
