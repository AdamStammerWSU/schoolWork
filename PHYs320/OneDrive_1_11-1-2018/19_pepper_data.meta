metadata for 19_pepper_data.csv

This is data we took as a class in Physics 320.
Each student drew a circle inside of a square.  The 
circle and square had the same diameter.  
Then, we sprinkled pepper (coarse ground) over the paper
and counted:

(first column) the number of pepper flakes within the circle

(second column) the number of pepper flakes in the area between the circle and the square.
