My name is Adam Stammer and I go to Winona State University. I'm studying computer science and physics as I work towards my bachelor's of science.
My current lan is to finish in just 2 more years but it may grow to be 3, depending on the minors I seek. I need to figure out what employers are actually
looking for though, before I make that decision.
